## üî® Features

- `Text-Based Interface` : Immerse yourself in the elegance of chess with a simple yet effective text-based interface.
- `Move Visualization` : Enter the source position of a piece to view the possible legal moves for that piece. The simulation highlights these positions on the board.
- `Positional Input` : Use algebraic notation (e.g., "a1", "h8") to input source and target positions for moving your pieces.
- `Move validation` : Guaranteed that all moves are legal according to chess rules.
- `Comprehensive Rule Enforcement` : This console game meticulously enforces  all the rules of chess, including legal moves, capturing, pawn promotion, castling and en passant.
- `Check and Checkmate Detection` : The game vigilantly tracks for checks and checkmates, providing alerts when a king is threatened or a player is in a losing position.
